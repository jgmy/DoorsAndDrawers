2022.02.07 I have time now to try to fix the many bugs of this game and make some improvements, but I forgot many details, despite of the many comments I put. I though I had fixed the inventory to be many screens wide. There is also a bug with the copier (putting a 3.5" disk in a Gui Computer and going to a copier should give you a map, password or hint). Perhaps I didn't push the changes from computer1 to github. I'm coding on computer2 now.
